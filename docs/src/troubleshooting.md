# Troubleshooting

If CompatHelper is failing despite everything being setup correctly following the previous instructions, try to delete the `Manifest.toml` file from the `src` folder (and from the `test` folder if any). See this [issue](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/CompatHelper.jl/issues/201) for more details.
